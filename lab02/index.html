            <p>There has been a lot to learn in such little time already, but it is exciting 
            to get to know this language thoroughly and see how the Web works.
            I have learned the way of transporting information quickly, and how fast it has improved
            throughout the years. I have learned how to set up a repository in Github as well as know the importance of details 
            in links, as it is literally a file pathway. And now here I am, making my own HTML site! I am excited to learn more 
            skills soon.</p>

    <h4>Three things I learned:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You can set a picture to fit the screen without scretching</li>
            <li>You can create tables and colorcode them</li>
            <li>You can even set a little picture for the tab's icon!</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>I used these two sites to help me!</h4>
