            <p>There has been a lot to learn in such little time already, but it is exciting 
            to get to know this language thoroughly and see how the Web works.
            I have learned the way of transporting information quickly, and how fast it has improved
            throughout the years. I have learned how to set up a repository in Github as well as know the importance of details 
            in links, as it is literally a file pathway. And now here I am, making my own HTML site! I am excited to learn more 
            skills soon.</p>

    <h4>Three things I learned:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You can set a picture to fit the screen without scretching</li>
            <li>You can create tables and colorcode them</li>
            <li>You can even set a little picture for the tab's icon!</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>I used these two sites to help me!</h4>
        <ol id="red">
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a></li>

            <p>Through completing this assignment, I have learned how to customize
                my HTML page through colors, alignments, fonts, and borders! I had some 
                trouble with getting ID and class selectors to work as I didn't quite understand it
                from W3schools, but I googled and found a post on Reddit that 
                helped explain it to me more easily. I also used MDNwebdocs and W3schools 
                a lot to help me figure out borders, especially with how to change link colors. 
                And finally, I had to turn to Google to see examples of how stylesheets were supposed to
                look to make sure I wasn't messing up. But through this research, I'm 
                fairly happy with what I've created, and am still excited to improve more.</p>
